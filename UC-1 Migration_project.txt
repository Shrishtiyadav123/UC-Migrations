The very first activity that I have been involved in is the migration. We have total 30 job plans available. We have a login production environment, which we got in. Then, we have to search each job plan on a production environment. Over the search bar, I got the pipeline structure, and each pipeline has 10 to 20 modules available.After right-clicking on the source object, you need to examine the process.Once you're in the process section, navigate to the left panel, click on Process, and search for the SQL queries. Afterwards, open the GitHub link and search for "xyz.sql."Once you find the SQL queries, inspect for any updates or renaming occurring. Ensure that data transfer is taking place by identifying and documenting the Excel sheet with the SQL query name, link, server name, and username. Make sure to examine the SQL queries to see which ones are actively transferring data.
